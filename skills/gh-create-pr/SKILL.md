description: >-
  Write a human-readable GitHub pull request description, then open or update
  the PR. Use when the user asks to create a PR, open a pull request, push a
  branch and open a PR, or rewrite a PR description. The description is the
  point: a short problem statement and a short explanation of the fix, written
  for a person deciding whether the change matters.

If the repository has its own `.agents/skills/gh-create-pr/` or `.claude/skills/gh-create-pr/`, stop and follow that one instead. It is the repo's specific version of this skill.

# Create a pull request

Agents already know how to push a branch and run `gh pr create`. Do that the
usual way. This skill only constrains the description.

The body is for a person scanning a queue, not for the next agent. They need
to see what was wrong, why it mattered, and what changed. They do not need a
tour of the diff.

## Description

These two sections are always first. Nothing goes above them: no issue link,
no summary bullets, no test plan, no generated release notes.

```markdown
## Problem

<four sentences maximum>

## Fix

<four sentences maximum>
```

### Problem

Four sentences maximum. Say what was wrong and why it was a problem. If an
issue exists, name it, but the sentences still have to stand on their own. A
link is not an explanation.

If a user or customer can feel this, say so in plain language: who hits it,
and what goes wrong for them. That is how a reader tells a valuable fix from
a technical rabbit hole.

If nobody outside the codebase feels it, say that too, in one sentence. Do
not dress an internal cleanup up as user impact.

### Fix

Four sentences maximum. Explain, conceptually, what changed so the problem
gets better. A reader who never opens the diff should understand the idea.

Do not list files, functions, flags, test counts, or commit hashes here.


### Data and Screenshots

If you have data (performance benchmarks, error rates, etc), you can include it (in its own section after "Fix"), but ensure you're presenting it and formatting it as an exec summary, not the appendix to a dissertation.

For user facing UI changes, if possible, include before and after screenshots of your changes.

### Below that

Anything else goes under those two sections: `Fixes #<number>`, a test plan,
implementation notes, review gates. Keep it out of the top. Only add sections that are genuinely helpful for reviewers to better understand the issue or its fix. Do not add process ceremony when none is needed. 

When the change was verified and reviewed locally (for example through
`land-change`), add this, and nothing more about the process:

```markdown
## Verification

- Local: <each command run, one line each>
- Review: <seat> and <seat> recommend merge at <short sha>
```

Keep review transcripts, finding lists and round-by-round history out of the
PR.

## Before you publish

Read the top two sections alone. If they could describe a hundred other
diffs, rewrite them. If they do not say whether a user feels this, rewrite
them.
