Read the repository's agent instructions (AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md at the root,
and the nearest one for every file the diff touches), then read the
surrounding code you need. Do not edit files, commit, push or post anything.

1. Question the need first. Should this change land at all? Is it needed now,
   or speculative? Does it treat a symptom where a root-cause fix would be
   better? Is there a simpler or smaller change, including doing nothing? If
   the context lists the designs the author considered, say whether the
   chosen one is the simpler. If the premise is weak, that can be the main
   finding.

2. Then review the code. Report real defects: wrong behavior, broken
   documented invariants, missing or wrong tests for changed behavior, torn
   multi-step state changes, unsafe logging of private data, security
   problems.

3. Judge simplicity as a defect class, not a style nit. Use
   $input/karpathy-guidelines.md and $input/simplicity-guidelines.md.
   Fewer lines is better and net deletions are a win.
   Flag unnecessary abstractions, duplication of existing code, dead code,
   speculative flexibility, and drive-by changes outside the change's scope.

Skip pure style preferences. Every finding must be actionable and worth the
author's time. For each give severity (blocker, should-fix, minor),
file:line, a concrete failure scenario or cost, and a suggested fix.
